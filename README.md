# How to use for dummysssssss.... jklmao

1. get any sort of OHCLV data

2. but lets assume you have OHCLV data, with the feature engineering module you can calculate up to 65 features for over 10k stocks within 2-5 mins (dependingon computer circumstances unless you have a bad laptop but either way its free and fast enough to be practical for most)

3. after you can visualize the data with the visualization module

# What needs to be done as of 7/12/25

1. expand from OHCLV data and prepare the feature engineering and visualzation module for higher level book data like from databento.

2. outlier detection of some sort / screener.... but i need to figure out what are good screeners and what is the bullshit noise.
