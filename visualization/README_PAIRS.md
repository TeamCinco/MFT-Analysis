## Quick Start

### Building the Application

```bash
# Option 1: Use the build script
./build_pairs.sh

# Option 2: Manual build
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake ..
make PairsVisualizer
```

### Running the Application

```bash
# From the visualization directory
./build/PairsVisualizer
```

The application will automatically load the sample cointegration data (`cointegration_sample.csv`).

## Data Format

The visualizer expects CSV files with the following columns:

```
Stock1,Stock2,ADF_Statistic,P_Value,Critical_1pct,Critical_5pct,Critical_10pct,
Half_Life_Days,Hedge_Ratio,Spread_Mean,Spread_StdDev,Max_Spread,Min_Spread,
Current_Spread,Z_Score,Grade,Is_Cointegrated,Entry_Threshold,Exit_Threshold,
Expected_Return,Sharpe_Ratio,Historical_Trades,Win_Rate
```

### Sample Data

- **Key Metrics**: All essential trading information in one view

### Pair Details Tab
- **Individual Analysis**: Complete breakdown of selected pair
- **Statistical Tests**: ADF results and critical values
- **Trading Metrics**: Performance and risk measures
- **Spread Analysis**: Current position and historical statistics

## Key Metrics Explained

### Statistical Measures
- **ADF Statistic**: Augmented Dickey-Fuller test statistic (more negative = more stationary)
- **P-Value**: Statistical significance (< 0.05 typically considered significant)
- **Critical Values**: Thresholds for 1%, 5%, and 10% significance levels

### Trading Metrics
- **Half-Life**: Average time for spread to mean-revert (shorter = faster reversion)
- **Z-Score**: Current spread position relative to historical mean
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted return measure
- **Win Rate**: Percentage of profitable historical trades

### Quality Classifications
- **Grade A**: High-quality pairs with strong statistical properties
- **Grade B**: Medium-quality pairs with acceptable metrics
- **Grade C**: Lower-quality pairs requiring careful evaluation
- **Outliers**: Pairs with exceptional performance metrics (Z-Score > 2.5, Sharpe > 2.0, Win Rate > 80%)

## Trading Interpretation

### Entry Signals
- **High Z-Score (> 2.0)**: Spread significantly above mean (potential short opportunity)
- **Low Z-Score (< -2.0)**: Spread significantly below mean (potential long opportunity)
- **Short Half-Life**: Faster mean reversion (better for short-term trades)

### Quality Indicators
- **High Sharpe Ratio (> 1.0)**: Good risk-adjusted returns
- **High Win Rate (> 60%)**: Consistent profitability
- **Low P-Value (< 0.05)**: Strong statistical cointegration

### Risk Factors
- **Long Half-Life (> 100 days)**: Slow mean reversion
- **High Spread Volatility**: Increased position risk
- **Low Historical Trades**: Limited backtesting data

## File Menu Options

### Load CSV
- Load your own cointegration data files
- Supports standard CSV format with headers
- Automatic data validation and parsing

### Export Filtered Data
- Save current filtered results to CSV
- Maintains all original columns and formatting
- Useful for further analysis or record-keeping

## Technical Requirements

### Dependencies
- OpenGL 3.3+
- GLFW3
- ImGui (included)
- ImPlot (included)
- C++17 compiler

### Supported Platforms
- macOS (tested)
- Linux (should work)
- Windows (should work with minor modifications)

## Troubleshooting

### Build Issues
```bash
# Ensure dependencies are installed (macOS)
brew install glfw3 pkg-config

# Clean build
rm -rf build && mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make PairsVisualizer
```

### Runtime Issues
- Ensure `cointegration_sample.csv` is in the visualization directory
- Check that OpenGL drivers are up to date
- Verify GLFW3 is properly installed

## Extending the Visualizer

### Adding New Metrics
1. Update `CointegrationData.h` with new fields
2. Modify CSV parsing in `CointegrationVisualizer.cpp`
3. Add new visualization functions
4. Update filtering logic if needed

### Custom Visualizations
- Use ImPlot functions to create new chart types
- Add new tabs in the `renderUI()` function
- Implement custom analysis functions

## Performance Notes

- Optimized for datasets up to 10,000 pairs
- Real-time filtering and sorting
- Efficient memory usage with smart data structures
- Responsive UI even with large datasets
